# The Safely Pattern

The Safely Pattern is a simple one. It allows you to tag non-critical code by wrapping it in a function. It’s built on top of exception handling and follows these rules:

1. Raise exceptions in development and test environments
2. Catch and report exceptions in other environments

Here’s a basic implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function safely(nonCriticalCode) {
  try {
    nonCriticalCode();
  } catch (e) {
    if (env === "development" || env === "test") {
      throw(e);
    }
    report(e);
  }
}
```

Its advantages over typical exception handling are:

1. It’s easier to write and debug code when errors aren’t caught in development and test environments
2. It allows you to keep reporting [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)

It’s recommended to mark exceptions when reporting so it’s clear they were handled with this pattern. One way of doing this is to prefix the exception message with `[safely]`.

There are currently implementations in [Ruby](https://github.com/ankane/safely) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/ankane/safely.js).
