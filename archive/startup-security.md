# Startup Security

A few simple steps to keep you secure.

1. Require 2-factor authentication for important accounts, like [Gmail](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/) and [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/).

2. Require hard drives to be encrypted. [FileVault makes this easy](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) on Macs.

3. Use [DMARC](https://dmarc.org/overview/) to verify emails sent from your domain. [dmarcian](https://dmarcian.com/) is one provider.

4. Use a team password manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/) to share passwords.
